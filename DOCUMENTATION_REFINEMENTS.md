## ✅ Refinements Completed

### 1. **Process Management Accuracy** ✅

- **Before**: "No PM2 or process supervisor (relies on manual restart)"
- **After**: "Currently managed via internal Node.js supervisor scripts (restart.ts / manager.ts). PM2 integration recommended for production reliability."
- **Impact**: Accurately reflects existing supervisor capabilities

### 2. **Monitoring Capabilities** ✅

- **Before**: "Limited health checks and alerting"
- **After**: "Basic status monitoring via `npm run status`; advanced health endpoint planned"
- **Impact**: Acknowledges existing status monitoring while noting planned improvements

### 3. **Polygon API Implementation** ✅

- **Before**: "Grouped aggs + bulk snapshots"
- **After**: "Bulk snapshots implemented; grouped aggs planned for optimization"
- **Impact**: Distinguishes between implemented and planned features

### 4. **Logo Management Status** ✅

- **Before**: "30-day cycle"
- **After**: "30-day cycle logic implemented"
- **Impact**: Clarifies that logic exists but may not be fully automated

### 5. **Performance Metrics Enhancement** ✅

- **Added**: "End-to-end daily cycle: ~6-7 minutes after reset"
- **Impact**: Provides complete performance picture

### 6. **Maintenance Checklist Enhancement** ✅

- **Added**: "Verify FinalReport count equals PolygonData(Boolean=true)"
- **Impact**: Includes data integrity verification step

### 7. **Status Statement Refinement** ✅

- **Before**: "Production Ready with Recommendations"
- **After**: "Production-ready foundation – stable core, improvements recommended for long-term maintainability"
- **Impact**: More nuanced and accurate status description

### 8. **Integration Overview Addition** ✅

- **Added**: Complete data pipeline flow diagram
- **Added**: Daily cycle visualization
- **Added**: Component architecture overview
- **Impact**: Provides immediate system understanding

### 9. **Formulation Improvements** ✅

- **Error Handling**: "Comprehensive" → "Robust Error Handling: Retry logic with transaction rollback and comprehensive logging"
- **Mobile**: "Mobile Optimization" → "Responsive UI: Verified desktop and mobile compatibility with optimized layouts"
- **Impact**: More precise and professional language
