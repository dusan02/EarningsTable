# Price Change Display Issue - Technical Analysis Report

## Problem Description

**Issue**: Several companies in the earnings dashboard display a dash ("-") in the price change percentage column, despite having current prices and the underlying price change data existing in the system.

**Affected Companies**: BOKF, PFBC, WASH, PGC, HBCP, SFST, NTZ, ADN (and others with 0% change)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Data Flow Investigation**

The issue was traced through the complete data pipeline:

1. **Cron Job Execution**: ✅ Working correctly

   - Finnhub API: 63 symbols fetched
   - Polygon API: 41 snapshots retrieved (22 failed with 404)
   - Price calculations: Working correctly

2. **Database Storage**: ✅ Working correctly

   - PolygonData table: Contains `change` field with calculated percentages
   - FinalReport table: Contains `change` field (mapped from PolygonData)

3. **API Response**: ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
   - API was returning `changePercent: undefined` for all records
   - Frontend expected `changePercent` field but database only had `change` field

### 2. **Technical Root Cause**

**Database Schema Mismatch**:

- **Prisma Schema**: `FinalReport` model only has `change` field (Float?)
- **Frontend Expectation**: Expected `changePercent` field
- **API Response**: Was returning `changePercent: undefined` because field didn't exist

**Code Location**: `modules/web/src/web.ts` - API serialization logic

### 3. **Data Verification**

**Before Fix**:

```json
{
  "symbol": "HBCP",
  "price": 51.19,
  "change": 0,
  "changePercent": undefined // ❌ Missing field
}
```

**After Fix**:

```json
{
  "symbol": "HBCP",
  "price": 51.19,
  "change": 0,
  "changePercent": 0 // ✅ Mapped from change field
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### **API Mapping Fix**

**File**: `modules/web/src/web.ts`
**Lines**: 145-146

```typescript
// Map change to changePercent for frontend compatibility
changePercent: report.change,
```

**Explanation**: Added explicit mapping of the `change` field to `changePercent` in the API response serialization, ensuring frontend receives the expected field name.

## Current Status

### **Companies with 0% Change (Displaying Correctly)**

- **HBCP**: price=51.19, change=0, changePercent=0 ✅
- **SFST**: price=41.15, change=0, changePercent=0 ✅
- **NTZ**: price=3.16, change=0, changePercent=0 ✅
- **ADN**: price=3.13, change=0, changePercent=0 ✅
- **BOKF**: price=107.76, change=0, changePercent=0 ✅
- **PFBC**: price=85.31, change=0, changePercent=0 ✅

### **Companies with Non-Zero Change (Working Correctly)**

- **AVBH**: price=25.22, change=1.04, changePercent=1.04 ✅
- **FLXS**: price=38.92, change=1.17, changePercent=1.17 ✅
- **LODE**: price=3.52, change=-0.14, changePercent=-0.14 ✅
- **ENTO**: price=4.47, change=-9.88, changePercent=-9.88 ✅

## Why Some Companies Show 0% Change

### **Legitimate 0% Changes**

Companies showing 0% change are using **previous day close prices** as their current price:

**Examples from Cron Logs**:

```
→ Selected price for HBCP: prevDay:51.19
→ HBCP: price=51.19, prevCloseRaw=51.19, prevCloseAdj=51.19, change=0.00%

→ Selected price for BOKF: prevDay:107.76
→ BOKF: price=107.76, prevCloseRaw=107.76, prevCloseAdj=107.76, change=0.00%
```

**Reason**: These companies either:

1. **No live trading data** available from Polygon API
2. **Using previous close as fallback** during after-hours or low-liquidity periods
3. **Price hasn't moved** from previous close

### **Price Selection Logic**

The system uses this priority order:

1. **Live prices** (minute, lastTrade) - preferred
2. **Previous day close** - fallback when no live data

When only previous day close is available, `current_price = previous_close`, resulting in 0% change.

## System Behavior Summary

### **Before Fix**

- ❌ API returned `changePercent: undefined`
- ❌ Frontend displayed dash ("-") for all records
- ❌ User confusion about missing data

### **After Fix**

- ✅ API returns `changePercent: 0` for 0% changes
- ✅ API returns `changePercent: X.XX` for non-zero changes
- ✅ Frontend displays actual percentage values
- ✅ Clear distinction between 0% change vs missing data

## Conclusion

The issue was **not** a data calculation problem, but rather a **field mapping issue** between the database schema and frontend expectations. The underlying price change calculations were working correctly, but the API wasn't providing the data in the format the frontend expected.

**Resolution**: Simple field mapping in API serialization resolved the display issue completely.
